* Don't get fall damage
* Larvae (silverfish and endermite) spawn with a bonus speed multiplying their speed up to 1.5 depending on local 
  difficulty
* Silverfishes are infesting the whole overworld (more than in mountains), and so mountains are even more infested than 
  before

### End

### Nether
* Magma cubes set on fire on collision, fire duration depends on size. No fire if blocking
* Blazes don't set on fire if their fire is not active and if their target is blocking

### Overworld

* Vexes die if their summoner dies

### Skeleton
* Have 5% chance to spawn with spectral arrows only
* Know a bit how to swim
* Strays shoot freezing arrows

* Merging plays a sound and creates particles

### Spider

* Can spit webs at targets that spawn a messy cobweb on collision with an entity

* Messy cobweb can't be placed on water, so you're immune on water
* Messy cobweb despawns after 5 to 10s and don't drop strings

## v1.5.2

### Configs

* Configs have been reorganized for more clarity: created sub-categories
* Zombie buff is more configurable: you can choose the percentage of damage dealt from players and from mobs 
  (separately) to zombies under the specified conditions

## v1.5.1

### Mobs

* Most hostile mobs are now hostile to villagers: same than previous version but excludes creepers as 
  they can't be targeted by iron golems

## v1.5

### Cave spider

* REALLY fixed crash when using the 1.18 preview datapacks, for the cave spider spawn in negative
  Y positions.

### Mobs

* Most hostile mobs are now hostile to villagers: includes spiders (only at night), skeletons, strays, 
  creepers and witches. Also includes zombies, husks, drowned, vindicators, pillagers... but was 
  already the case

## v1.4.1

### Cave spider

* Fixed the spawn light level: now spawn if light <= to 7
* Fixed crash when using the 1.18 preview datapacks, for the cave spider spawn in negative 
  Y positions. Note that they may not spawn at all with the official datapack, as it override 
  mob spawns for every biomes!
  
### Enderman

* When you get the blindness effect, you are now sure that you aggro the enderman
* You will now get the effect only when you aggro it, after staring at it. So it's now a bit 
  easier to deal with them, as you can stare at them to stop them without getting blindness 
  effect every time. You won't get the effect if you aggro them without staring at them

## v1.4

### Patrols

* Vindicators can now spawn in patrols. They have 10 to 20% chance to spawn instead of a 
  pillager (depending local difficulty). 
* If it didn't spawn a vindicator, it has 5 to 10% chance to spawn a ravager. The ravager 
  may spawn with a pillager riding it or not.

### Cave spiders

* Cave spider can spawn naturally in caves. The deeper they try to spawn, the most 
  possible it is for them to really spawn. So they should be more rare at higher Y 
  positions. They can spawn in group of 1 to 3.
* Cave spider jockey can spawn with a chance of 1/50 (can't spawn from a cave spider 
  spawner!)

### Configs

* Configs are now in different menus to find what you want more quickly. They are
  separated by associated dimension
* You can now set the number of golden armor you need to be safe with piglins

  choose between NONE, ZOMBIE_ONLY, NO_DROWNED, NO_PIGLIN, and ALL

### Zombie

* Fixed damage so that they can get 0 damage instead of 1 if the damage was initially lesser than 1
